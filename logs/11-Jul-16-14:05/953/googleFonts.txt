This guide explains how to use the Google Fonts API to add fonts to your web
pages. You don't need to do any programming; all you have to do is add a special
stylesheet link to your HTML document, then refer to the font in a CSS style.
Here's an example. Copy and paste the following HTML into a file:
Then open the file in a modern web browser. You should see a page displaying the
following, in the font called Tangerine:
That sentence is ordinary text, so you can change how it looks by using CSS. Try
adding a shadow to the style in the previous example:
You should now see a drop shadow under the text:
And that's only the beginning of what you can do with the Fonts API and CSS.
You can start using the Google Fonts API in just two steps:
Add a stylesheet link to request the desired web font(s):

Style an element with the requested web font, either in a stylesheet:

or with an inline style on the element itself:

For a list of fonts you can use, see

.
To determine what URL to use in your stylesheet link, start with the Google
Fonts API base URL:
Then, add the 
 URL parameter, with one or more font family names and
styles.
For example, to request the

 font:
To request multiple font families, separate the names with a pipe character
(
).
For example, to request the fonts

,

, and

:
Requesting multiple fonts allows you to use all of those fonts in your page.
(But don't go overboard; most pages don't need very many fonts, and requesting a
lot of fonts may make your pages slow to load.)
The Google Fonts API provides the regular version of the requested fonts by
default. To request other styles or weights, append a colon (
) to the name of
the font, followed by a list of styles or weights separated by commas (
).
For example:
To find out which styles and weights are available for a given font, see the
font's listing in 
.
For each style you request, you can give either the full name or an
abbreviation; for weights, you can alternatively specify a numerical weight:
For example, to request Cantarell italic and Droid Serif bold, you could use any
of the following URLs:

Some of the fonts in the 

support multiple scripts (like Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek for example). In order
to specify which subsets should be downloaded the subset parameter should be
appended to the URL.
For example, to request the Cyrillic subset of the

 font, the URL
would be:
To request the Greek subset of the

 font, the URL
would be:
To request both Greek and Cyrillic subsets of the

 font, the URL
would be:
The Latin subset is always included if available and need not be specified.
Please note that if a client browser supports unicode-range
(
)
the subset parameter is ignored; the browser will select from the subsets
supported by the font to get what it needs to render the text.
For a complete list of available fonts and font subsets please see

.
Oftentimes, when you want to use a web font on your website or application, you
know in advance which letters you'll need. This often occurs when you're using a
web font in a logo or heading.
In these cases, you should consider specifying a 
 value in your font
request URL. This allows Google to return a font file that's optimized for your
request. In some cases, this can reduce the size of the font file by up to 90%.
To use this new beta feature, simply add 
 to your Google Fonts API
requests. For example if you're only using Inconsolata for the title of your
blog, you can put the title itself as the value of 
. Here is what the
request would look like:
As with all query strings, you should URL-encode the value:
This feature also works for international fonts, allowing you to specify UTF-8
characters. For example, Â¡Hola! is represented as:
When making headers or display texts on your website, you'll often want to
stylize your text in a decorative way. To simplify your work, Google has
provided a collection of font effects that you can use with minimal effort to
produce beautiful display text. For example:
To use this new beta feature, simply add 
 to your Google
Fonts API request and add the corresponding class name to the HTML element(s)
that you want to affect. In our example above, we used the 

font effect, so the request would look like:
To use the effect, add the corresponding class name to your HTML element(s). The
corresponding class name is always the effect name prefixed with 
,
so the class name for 
 would be 
:
You can request multiple effects by separating the effect names with a pipe
character (
).
Here is a complete listing of all the font effects that we offer:
There are many more ways to style your fonts, and many things are possible
through CSS. We are simply providing a few ideas to get you started. For more
