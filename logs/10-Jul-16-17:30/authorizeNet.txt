This error indicates that Authorize.Net is unable to connect to the page that you have specified as your relay response url and is commonly encountered during development if you are using an internal test environment.
We also recommend triple checking the URL within your code making sure it is the correct one and same one specified in your Authorize.Net settings page.
There are no plans to introduce breaking changes into the JSON request/response. We are only marking it as beta in the chance that we are forced to make a breaking change in order to address a bug or unexpected behavior.
Please
